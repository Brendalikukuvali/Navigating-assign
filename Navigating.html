<h1>RELIGION,COMMUNICATION AND RESPONSIBILITY</h1>

<h2>Religion</h2>

<P>In chapter one Noah says that his childhood involved church or some form church where they had something to do each and every day at least four nights a week. Tuesday was the night of prayer meeting, Wednesday night was Bible study, Thursday night was Youth church, Friday and Saturday they had off and then on Sunday they went to church. His mother took him to three different churches the reason being that each church gave something different.</P>

<P>The first church offered jubilant praise of the Lord, the second church offered deep analysis of the scripture, which his mom loved and the third church offered passion and catharsis; it was a place where you truly felt the presence of the Holy Spirit inside you. During this movement back and forth Noah noticed that each church had its own distinct racial makeup: Jubilant church was a mixed church; that is the white people and the black people, Analytical church was white people’s church and finally Passionate cathartic church that was black people’s church. Noah enjoyed going to all the churches. He loved the white peoples church because he used not to go the main service and rather he could attend Sunday school where they got to read cool stories and his favorite was Noah and the flood because he had his personal stake there he also loved other stories like David slaying Goliath among others.

<p>When we compare Trevor Noah’s live to the people’s way of live today we find out that there is a big difference. One way is that although there is still things to do with; prayer meeting, Youth church and Bible study few people and churches do that.On the part of moving from one church to another you can find a few or no people going to different churches on the same day which is Sunday. Trevor Noah’s live was cool as he was fed spiritually from different churches which was made possible by his loving and caring mom as he called her. </p>

<h3>Communication</h3>

<p>Chapter four the Chameleon is also one of the most in interesting chapters in the book. Trevor learned to use different languages just like his mother did and it became a tool that served him through his whole life. One day as he was walking down the street, a group of Zulu guys was walking behind him, closing in on him, and he could hear them talking to one another about how they were going to mug him.”Asibambe le autie yomlungu. Phuma ngapha mina ngizoqhamuka ngevuma kwake.”Meaning let’s get this white guy .You go to his left, and I’ll come up behind him. Trevor didn’t know what to do, he could run, so he just spun around real quick and said “Kodwa bafwethu yingani singavele sibambe umuntu inkunzi? Asenzeni.Mina ngikulindele.”Which meant that you guys why don’t we just mug someone together? Let’s do it.</p>

<p>They looked shocked for a moment, and then they started laughing. They Said to him that they thought he was something else. They wanted to do a violent harm to him but when they felt they were part of the same tribe  due to his capability of talking other languages they became cool with each other. This and so many other smaller incidents in Trevor’s life, made him realize that language, even more than color, defines who you are to people. This still even apply to the in society as mostly people find it easy interacting with those who they have a common language. This also shows that if Trevor had not spoken to them in their language something could have happened to him since they felt he was part of them.</p>

<h4>Responsibility</h4>

<p>The other amazing part is chapter Seven “Fufi” wher Trevor talks of  the two dogs Fufi and Panther. Panther was his mom’s dog will Fufi was his. Fufi was Trevor’s love but but they considered her stupid. She could jump super high, could do all sorts of tricks and Trevor says that if You Tube had been around  Fufi would have been a star. Fufi was such a playful dog beautiful, clean lines and a happy face. Whenever they called them , Panther would come right away, but Fufi wouldn’t do anything. They discovered  that Fufi was deaf after her death which was caused by a burglar who was trying to break into their house. He pushed the gate over and it fell on Fufi’s back and broke her spine.

<p>When they took her to a vet that is when they were told that she was deaf. This was after the vet had examined her. It was strange them having been living with a dog which was deaf and they couldn’t notice anything wrong. Before Fufi’s death there was a boy who had claimed that Fufi was his dog since Fufi used to go their home after Trevor had gone to school and his mother to her work place. Trevor and his mother tried every possible way to prove that Fufi was their dog but did not succeed. In order to solve the matter Trevor’s mother decided to give the boy’s mother some money so that they can get the dog back.</p>

<p>Trevor and his mother loved Fufi so much despite her being just a dog. Their love for the dog made them to buy Fufi back even though it was their dog. His mother is a peace loving lady as she ensured that they solved the issue to do with the dog in a peaceful manner without any form of conflict between them. She set a good example which should be emulated by other women in the society to ensure that they don’t allow small issues between then and their children cause conflict. It shows the importance of prevaillance of peace in the society. </p>
